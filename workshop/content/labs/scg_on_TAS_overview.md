## Spring Cloud Gateway on TAS Overview

<br/>


Tanzu Spring Cloud Gateway provides API gateway capabilities on the Tanzu. The product integrates with the Platformâ€™s identity management services, Tanzu Single Sign-On and container networking.

Developers can configure routes on the Gateway service instance via JSON during service binding. This way, development teams can dynamically manage route configuration via source control, instead of ticket-based workflows or cumbersome centralized API gateway appliances.

## Spring Cloud Gateway Operator

We installed Spring cloud gateway operator on the workshop cluster.

1. The spring cloud gateway operator installed three kubernetes custom resources definitions. Execute the command 
   `kubectl get crds` and you will see all the created custom CRDs shown below. These CRDs will be used to configure 
   the gateway. 
   
```shell
NAME                                              CREATED AT
springcloudgatewaymappings.tanzu.vmware.com       2021-03-10T01:02:51Z
springcloudgatewayrouteconfigs.tanzu.vmware.com   2021-03-10T01:02:51Z
springcloudgateways.tanzu.vmware.com              2021-03-10T01:02:51Z
```

2. execute the command  `kubectl get all -n spring-cloud-gateway` you should see a pod running the spring cloud gateway 
operator as shown below. 
   
```text
